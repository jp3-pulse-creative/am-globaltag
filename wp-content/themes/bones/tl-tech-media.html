  <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-10"> <span class="tech-header">THE A&amp;M TECH VIEW FROM NORTH AMERICA</span> <span class="tech-media-2">There were 199 technology transactions in the fourth quarter, which was largely in line with the same quarter last year.  Full year 2016 technology M&amp;A was also on par with prior year, accounting for 908 transactions, which was 2.0% higher than 2015.  The four largest transactions in the fourth quarter were Elliott Management’s sale of Mentor Graphics to Siemens for $4.0 billion, Thoma Bravo’s sale of Deltek to Roper Technologies for $2.8 billion, Golden Gate Capital’s take private acquisition of NeuStar for $2.7 billion, and Bressemer Ventures sale of LifeLock to Symantec for $2.1 billion.  As with the rest of 2016, fourth quarter volume was largely driven by private equity through their execution roll-up strategies and exits of previous investments via IPO or a sale to a public company.  </span> <span class="tech-media-2">We expect these trends to continue in 2017.  There is arguably more money than ever available for acquisitions: private equity dry powder is at an all-time high, public company balance sheets are stronger than ever with the surging public equities market, debt remains relatively cheap compared to historical levels, and foreign entities are entering the space at a never seen before level, for example Softbank’s $100 billion tech fund. This unprecedented level of availability will drive up demand and multiples, creating a very attractive exit market for current private equity tech investments.  In addition, activist investors have latched onto the space, driving underperforming companies to look into strategic alternatives much quicker than they otherwise would have.  We do not believe the looming uncertainty of the Trump administration’s populism policies, or rising interest rates will do much to slow down these trends.</span> </div>

  <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-10"> <span class="tech-header">THE A&amp;M MEDIA VIEW FROM NORTH AMERICA</span> <span class="tech-media-2"> There were 41 media transactions in North America in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 26.8% versus same quarter last year.  The decline drove 2016 transaction volume to be 197, 3.4% less than 2015.  The fourth quarter, however, will not be remembered for its decline in volume.  Instead, it will be defined by AT&amp;T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner for $105 billion, one of the largest media deals ever.  This is the third telecom provider to expand into the media space, following Comcast’s acquisition of NBC in 2011 and Verizon’s acquisition of AOL in 2015 and pending acquisition of Yahoo.  We don’t expect it to be the last.  We believe acquisitions such as these will continue as traditional telecom providers fight to stay relevant in the world of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. It is hard to say if they will continue at this scale though.  On the day the Time Warner deal was announced, President-Elect Trump publicly announced he was against it, stating “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few”.  Based on Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, such deals may be harder than they once were, especially if they eliminate American jobs in the name of “synergies”.</span> <span class="tech-media-2"> We expect media M&A transaction volume to accelerate in 2017 as other telecoms strive to stay competitive in the digital economy. </span> </div>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8"> <span class="tech-media tm-7"> The proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner by leading U.S. telecom operator AT&T was the main deal of the quarter. Valuing Time Warner at $109billion, it is the largest acquisition involving a major media and a telecom/cable company since the 2011/2013 acquisition of NBCUniversal by cable operator Comcast.</span> <span class="tech-media tm-8"> T-Mobile NL acquired the fixed assets from Vodafone NL (Vodafone Thuis). This gives T-Mobile NL (until then a mostly mobile operator) 150,000 fixed customers – most of which have a triple play service (TV, fixed telephony and internet services). </span> <span class="tech-media tm-9"> Russia’s leading mobile telecommunication operator MegaFon acquired a controlling stake in Mail.ru, a leader in the provision of e-mail services as well as the owner of one of Russia’s largest internet portals, three Russian social networks and Russia’s largest online game business for $740million.</span> <span class="tech-media tm-10"> Telenet Group acquired SFR Belgium and Luxembourg (SFR Belux) from Altice for an enterprise value of €400million.</span> </div>

    <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-10"> <span class="tech-header">THE A&amp;M TELECOM VIEW FROM NORTH AMERICA</span> <span class="tech-media-2"> There were 23 telecom transactions in North America in the fourth quarter, an 8.0% decrease versus the same quarter last year.  This decline was offset by a strong first and third quarter, which drove the total 2016 deal count to 96, up 5.5% from 2015.  Despite being down on a volume basis in the fourth quarter, CenturyLink announced its $34 billion acquisition of Level 3 Communications in October, which was the largest telecom deal of year.  In addition, Equinix announced the acquisition of 24 datacenters from Verizon for $3.6 billion and Global Secure Infrastructure announced the acquisition of 57 datacenters from a consortium including Catbird Networks, Cryptzone and Easy Solutions for $2.8 billion, driving fourth quarter to be the highest on a dollar value basis.  In addition, similar to the third quarter, we continue to see the activity in the mobile, network and cable equipment space, which drove approximately a third of the deal volume in 2016. The biggest story about telecom, however, isn’t in telecom.  The lines are getting ever so grey with Media M&amp;A (see our Media cover below).</span> <span class="tech-media-2"> We expect telecom M&amp;A to remain strong in 2017 as private equity firms continue to drive consolidation and publicly traded telecom companies continue to acquire their way into new technologies and markets. </span> </div>
